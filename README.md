# Technical test for Weenat

## Brief

Create a monthly calendar React app.

The user must be able to:

- naviguate across months and years
- create an event on click on a day (the event must then be shown on the day)
- remove the event

## Time spent on it

The project has been started on May 25th 2025 and here how the time has been spent:

- May 25th: almost all day on it
- between May 26th & 28th: a few hours on it whenever I had a bit of time
- May 29th: all afternoon on it
- from May 30th: a few hours on it whenever I had a bit of time
- June 2nd: project is finished
- June 3rd: commit changes that were still local and update the [README.md](./README.md) file

## Installation

As every required package is mentioned in the [package.json](./package.json) file, a simple install is enough:

```shell
